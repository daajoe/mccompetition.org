# Workshop on Counting and Sampling 2022

Coming soon.

<!---
## Purpose
The _International Workshop on Counting and Sampling_ aims to provide a venue for researchers working on
model counting such as model counting (mc), weighted model counting/sum of products (wmc), 
projected model counting (pmc) as well as sampling models within the realm but not restricting to 
Boolean satisfiability (SAT),  satisfiability modulo theories (SMT), Answer set programming (ASP), 
and constraint programming (CP). 
It encourages to meet, communicate, and discuss the latest theoretical and practical results, 
in particular results on novel solvers, related solver technologies, new theoretical advances, 
practical academic and industrial applications as well as the linking theory and practice. 
 The workshop is also the place for developers of model counters to present their solvers and 
 the presentation of detailed results on the model counting competition.

## Interest
Main areas of interest include, but are not restricted to:

- techniques for debugging or certifying solvers
- visualisation of benchmarks structure
- monitoring solver behaviour
- evaluation of solvers
- efficient data structures
- domain specific encodings
- taking into account multi-core technology
- domain specific heuristics
- new application of constraint-based technologies
- new use cases of constraint-based technologies
- system/library description
- solver API

## Venue
We refer to the [SAT 2021 Website](https://www.iiia.csic.es/sat2021/venue/).

## Registration
Workshop requires no registration fee. 
Please, register on the [SAT 2021 Webpage](https://www.iiia.csic.es/sat2021/registration/).
If you select workshop only, registration is free.

## Program
See [Detailed Program of the Workshop](mcw_program)

## Timeline
- June  1, 2021: Abstract submission deadline
- June 10, 2021: Notification to authors
- June 12, 2021: Program available on the workshop website
- **July 6, 2021: Online Workshop.**<br/>
Timeslot of about 3 hours in the late afternoon CEST, 
in time between 4:00pm and 8:00 pm (CEST). 



## Format
You present your best work related to counting and sampling,
be it published elsewhere or yet unpublished. 
Due to travel restrictions throughout Europe and the world, 
we expect an online workshop.

## Agenda / Talks
- 15min (Talk, live or pre-recorded)
- 10min (Q&A)
- 5min break

## Submissions
Submission: We place no format requirement. We expect that you provide
a reasonable description in txt or pdf-format and upload this on 
[Easychair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=mc2021).


Procedures for selecting papers: 
All submissions will be reviewed by 3-4 program committee members 
and papers will be selected based on their recommendations.

Plans for dissemination: There will be no proceedings, 
we will make the abstract, slides, and recorded video 
publicly available at the website. If the authors agree, we will
also place this publicly as a tarball under CC-BY on a public 
repository such as Zenodo.



## Out of Scope
Papers claiming to resolve a major long-standing open
 theoretical question in Mathematics or Computer Science 
 are outside the scope of the workshop.
