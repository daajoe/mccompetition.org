# Competition

The _5th Competition on Model Counting (MC 2024)_ is a competition to deepen the relationship between latest theoretical
and practical development on the various model counting problems and their practical applications. It targets the
problem of counting the number of models of a Boolean formula.

Further details on the competition can be found at: [Competition 2024](2024/mc_description)
<br /><br />

# Workshop on Counting and Sampling

The _International Workshop on Model Counting and Sampling_ aims to provide a venue for researchers working on
model counting such as model counting (mc), weighted model counting/sum of products (wmc),
projected model counting (pmc) as well as sampling models within the realm but not restricting to
Boolean satisfiability (SAT),
satisfiability modulo theories (SMT), Answer set programming (ASP), and constraint programming (CP).
It encourages to meet, communicate, and discuss the latest theoretical and practical results,
in particular results on novel solvers, related solver technologies, new theoretical advances,
practical academic and industrial applications as well as the linking theory and practice.
The workshop is also the place for developers of model counters and samplers to present their programs
and the presentation of detailed results on the model counting competition.
