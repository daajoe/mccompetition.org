# Model Counting (MC-2022)

<span style="color:red">The model counting competition instances are online for Track 1 and submission is open on StarExec.<br/> 
See updates: [STATUS and NEWS](news).

# Competition

The _2nd Competition on Model Counting (MC 2022)_ is a competition to deepen the relationship between latest theoretical and practical development on the various model counting problems and their practical applications. It targets the problem of counting the number of models of a Boolean formula. 

Further details on the competition can be found at: [Competition 2022](2022/mc_description)
<br /><br />

# Workshop on Counting and Sampling
The _International Workshop on Model Counting and Sampling_ aims to provide a venue for researchers working on 
model counting such as model counting (mc), weighted model counting/sum of products (wmc), 
projected model counting (pmc) as well as sampling models within the realm but not restricting to 
Boolean satisfiability (SAT),  
satisfiability modulo theories (SMT), Answer set programming (ASP), and constraint programming (CP). 
It encourages to meet, communicate, and discuss the latest theoretical and practical results, 
in particular results on novel solvers, related solver technologies, new theoretical advances, 
practical academic and industrial applications as well as the linking theory and practice. 
The workshop is also the place for developers of model counters and samplers to present their programs 
and the presentation of detailed results on the model counting competition.
