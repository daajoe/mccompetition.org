# Model Counting
ModelCounting.org aims to provide a venue for researchers working on model counting such as 
model counting (mc), weighted model counting/sum of products (wmc), projected model counting 
(pmc) within the realm but not restricting to Boolean satisfiability (SAT), 
satisfiability modulo theories (SMT), Answer set programming (ASP), 
and constraint programming (CP). 
It encourages to meet, communicate, and discuss the latest theoretical and 
practical results, in particular results on novel solvers, 
related solver technologies, new theoretical advances, 
practical academic and industrial applications as well as the linking 
theory and practice. 

The competition intends to deepen the relationship 
between latest theoretical and practical development on the various model counting 
problems and their practical applications. 
We aim to identify new challenging benchmarks and to promote new solvers for the problem as well as to compare them with state-of-the-art solvers.
Model counting is very vibrant field that provided both recent advances in theory as well as in practical solving including various applications. State-of-the-art SAT or WMC (weighted model counting) search engines rely on various techniques such as  SAT-based solving, knowledge compilation, or approximate solving by means of sampling using SAT solvers. There have been also successful implementations for parallel and distributed computation as well as massively parallel computation approaches. 

Organized workshops provide a place for developers of model counters to present 
their solvers, for organizers to provide detailed results on the model counting 
competition, for users of tools in the realm of model counting to illustrate their applications,
and for theoretical researchers to present latest results on solving.



## Other Competitions
 MC 2021 follows a direction in the community of constraint solving, where already many competitions have been organized such as on [ASP](https://sites.google.com/view/aspcomp2019/) (7 editions), [CSP](http://xcsp.org/competition) (19 editions), [SAT](http://sat-race-2019.ciirc.cvut.cz/) (19 editions), [SMT](https://smt-comp.github.io/2019/) (14 editions), [MaxSAT](https://maxsat-evaluations.github.io/2019/) Evaluation (13 editions), [QBF](http://www.qbflib.org/) (8 editions).

  Martin Josef Geiger keeps a nice [list of various other computational challenges](https://www.hsu-hh.de/logistik/research/challenges) out there.



<!-- Beside the theoretical research there are many implementations available, just to name some state of the art solvers, c2d, d4, DSHARP, miniC2D, cnf2eadt, bdd_minisat_all, and sdd (based on knowledge compilation techniques); ApproxMC4, and sts (based on approximate counting or sampling); Cache, sharpCDCL4, and sharpSAT (CDCL-based solvers using component caching); gpusat, countAntom, and dCountAntom) (parallel or distributed solvers). There are also preprocessors available B+E and pmc. Many solvers are highly competitive and solve various instances. However, there has still not been a competition on the topics related to model counting.  -->

<!-- # Previous Work

Previous simulations included works on the [Turing](https://www.cs.uni-potsdam.de/bs/research/labs.html#turing) and [Zuse](https://www.cs.uni-potsdam.de/bs/research/labsZuse.html) Cluster at University of Potsdam for various projects. As well as various clusters at TU Wien, more detailed, [Behemoth](https://www.ac.tuwien.ac.at/students/), Cobra, which Markus and I helped to congure for operations, and Lion used for the ASP'14 Competition at FLoC Clusters. In addition, we contributed to [benchmark-tools](https://github.com/potassco/benchmark-tool), which allow reproducibility of benchmarks under various cluster schedulers. Finally, Markus Hecher and I were organizers of the 4th Parameterized Algorithms and Computational Experiments Challenge (PACE 2019).
