## Field of Research -->

Model counting is very vibrant field that provided both recent advances in theory as well as in practical solving including various applications. State-ofthe-art SAT or WMC (weighted model counting) search engines so far rely on standard techniques from SAT-based solving, knowledge compilation, or approximate solving by means of sampling using SAT solvers. There have been also successful implementations for parallel and distributed computation as well as massively parallel computation approaches.  
<!-- Beside the theoretical research there are many implementations available, just to name some state of the art solvers, c2d, d4, DSHARP, miniC2D, cnf2eadt, bdd_minisat_all, and sdd (based on knowledge compilation techniques); ApproxMC4, and sts (based on approximate counting or sampling); Cache, sharpCDCL4, and sharpSAT (CDCL-based solvers using component caching); gpusat, countAntom, and dCountAntom) (parallel or distributed solvers). There are also preprocessors available B+E and pmc. Many solvers are highly competitive and solve various instances. However, there has still not been a competition on the topics related to model counting.  -->

#  Applied Computational Methods and Programs
The solving algorithms will be based on various combinatorial modeling and solving paradigms. As programming languages we plan to allow C, C++, C#, Java8, Java10, Python2, Python3, Rust, and VB.NET. The source code of the solvers have to be released under an open source license (e.g. GPL, MIT, or public domain). The used solvers in the back-end may include commercial solvers such as [IBM Cplex](http://www-01.ibm.com/software/integration/optimization/cplex-optimizer), [gurobi](https://www.gurobi.com/), as well as open source solvers. For parallel solving on GPUs, we aim for Nvidia cuda.

<!-- # Previous Work

Previous simulations included works on the [Turing](https://www.cs.uni-potsdam.de/bs/research/labs.html#turing) and [Zuse](https://www.cs.uni-potsdam.de/bs/research/labsZuse.html) Cluster at University of Potsdam for various projects. As well as various clusters at TU Wien, more detailed, [Behemoth](https://www.ac.tuwien.ac.at/students/), Cobra, which Markus and I helped to congure for operations, and Lion used for the ASP'14 Competition at FLoC Clusters. In addition, we contributed to [benchmark-tools](https://github.com/potassco/benchmark-tool), which allow reproducibility of benchmarks under various cluster schedulers. Finally, Markus Hecher and I were organizers of the 4th Parameterized Algorithms and Computational Experiments Challenge (PACE 2019).
