# Workshop on Counting and Sampling 2021



## Purpose
The _International Workshop on Counting and Sampling_ aims to provide a venue for researchers working on
model counting such as model counting (mc), weighted model counting/sum of products (wmc), 
projected model counting (pmc) as well as sampling models within the realm but not restricting to 
Boolean satisfiability (SAT),  satisfiability modulo theories (SMT), Answer set programming (ASP), 
and constraint programming (CP). 
It encourages to meet, communicate, and discuss the latest theoretical and practical results, 
in particular results on novel solvers, related solver technologies, new theoretical advances, 
practical academic and industrial applications as well as the linking theory and practice. 
 The workshop is also the place for developers of model counters to present their solvers and 
 the presentation of detailed results on the model counting competition.

## Interest
Main areas of interest include, but are not restricted to:

- techniques for debugging or certifying solvers
- visualisation of benchmarks structure
- monitoring solver behaviour
- evaluation of solvers
- efficient data structures
- domain specific encodings
- taking into account multi-core technology
- domain specific heuristics
- new application of constraint-based technologies
- new use cases of constraint-based technologies
- system/library description
- solver API

## Timeline
[here](dates).

## Submissions
The Workshop on Model Counting allows optional publication: there will be electronic proceedings in which accepted contributions may be published in case the authors wish so. But to allow for publication elsewhere and the submission of work already published, the authors also have the option of their contribution not appearing in the proceedings. Consequently, there we invite two types of submissions:

- Publishable papers: this type of submission is for work that the authors wish to publish in the proceedings. It should describe original work on a topic of the workshop, including papers whose focus might be too narrow to be published in a conference. System descriptions of model counters and related solver technologies are also welcome. Submissions of this type have to be formatted with the [EasyChair style](https://easychair.org/publications/easychair.zip) and should consist of at most 14 pages excluding references. 
- Presentation-only contributions: this type of submissions is for work that the authors do **not** want to appear in the proceedings. Is should describe work on a topic of the workshop. We explicitly also invite work in progress and work that has recently been accepted or published at another conference, but that the community may have missed (including, e.g., domain-specific applications of declarative solvers at the respective domain-specific conferences). Submissions to this category should be abstracts of 1-2 pages in any reasonable format and will be evaluated only on their relevance to the workshop.

For both types of submissions source code and data downloads are appreciated. An appendix or external material is allowed, but will be considered at the reviewers' discretion. For presentation-only contributions the authors can also add published or preprint version of the submitted work.

The contributions must be submitted electronically through [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=mcw2020) as a PDF file in the format described above.

Submissions are not expected to be double-blind, but can be submitted double blind if the authors prefer.


## Out of Scope
Papers claiming to resolve a major long-standing open theoretical question in Mathematics or Computer Science are outside the scope of the workshop.
