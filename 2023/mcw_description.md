# Workshop on Counting and Sampling 2023

## Purpose
The _International Workshop on Counting and Sampling_ aims to provide a venue for researchers working on
model counting such as model counting (mc), weighted model counting/sum of products (wmc), 
projected model counting (pmc) as well as sampling models within the realm but not restricting to 
Boolean satisfiability (SAT),  satisfiability modulo theories (SMT), Answer set programming (ASP), 
and constraint programming (CP). 
It encourages to meet, communicate, and discuss the latest theoretical and practical results, 
in particular results on novel solvers, related solver technologies, new theoretical advances, 
practical academic and industrial applications as well as the linking theory and practice. 
 The workshop is also the place for developers of model counters to present their solvers and 
 the presentation of detailed results on the model counting competition.

<!---
## Interest
Main areas of interest include, but are not restricted to:

- techniques for debugging or certifying solvers
- visualisation of benchmarks structure
- monitoring solver behaviour
- evaluation of solvers
- efficient data structures
- domain specific encodings
- taking into account multi-core technology
- domain specific heuristics
- new application of constraint-based technologies
- new use cases of constraint-based technologies
- system/library description
- solver API

## Venue
The workshop will be colocated with the Workshops at the SAT 2023 Conference.

## Timeline
- **May 1, 2022: Submission Deadline**
- June 1, 2022: Notification of Acceptance
- August 11, 2022: Workshop
-->

## Timeline
see [Dates](dates)

## Format
You present your best work related to counting and sampling,
be it published elsewhere or yet unpublished. 

## Agenda / Talks
- 20min (Talk) + 10min (Q&A)
- 5min break

## Submissions
Submission: We place no format requirement. We expect that you provide
a reasonable description in txt or pdf-format and upload this on 
[Easychair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=mc2022).


Procedures for selecting papers: 
All submissions will be reviewed by 1-2 program committee members 
and papers will be selected based on their recommendations.

Plans for dissemination: There will be no proceedings, 
we will make the abstract and slides video publicly available 
at the website.  If authors additionally pre-record a video, 
it will be distributed among the participants.

<!--
## Out of Scope
Papers claiming to resolve a major long-standing open
 theoretical question in Mathematics or Computer Science 
 are outside the scope of the workshop.
