<br><br>

<center><b>Send us an email and stay tuned.</b></center>

## Tracks / Challenges
1. **Model Counting (mc)**<br/>
2. **Weighted Model Counting (wmc)**<br/>
3. **Projected Model Counting (pmc)**<br/>
4. **Projected Weighted Model Counting (pwmc)**<br/>

## Call for Benchmarks
Model Counting Competition invites extended submissions of collections of counting instances in the 
an [DIMACS-like submission format as used in the 2021 competition](../../assets/files/2021/competition2021.pdf).

<!-- - [Call for Benchmarks 2023 (PDF)](../../assets/files/2022/call_for_benchmarks2022.pdf) -->
- [Call for Benchmarks 2023 (TEXT)](cfb2023)

## Rules
### Ranking
- A. Exact (arbitrary precision)
- B. Exact (small precision loss)
- C. Approximate (provide approximation guarantee)
- D. Heuristic (experimental)

### Restictions
- Runtime: 3600s
- Memory: 32GB
- TempDisk Space: available for input transformation and preprocessing
- Precision (in relative error A,B,D): 
  - Ranking A: 0.0 (any wrong solution results in disqualification)
  - Ranking B: 0.001 (more than 20 solutions outside margin results in disqualification)
  - Ranking C: $\alpha=0.8$ (more than 20 solutions outside margin results in disqualification)
  - Ranking D: 20% (correct answer: 1 point, otherwise: 0 points)

### Benchmark Selection
We precompute instances and discard those that can be solved by
standard solvers within less than 10s and keep at most 40 instances
that cannot be solved by common existing solver. 

## Instances
