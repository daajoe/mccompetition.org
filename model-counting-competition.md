#  Allowed Solvers
The solving algorithms can be based on various combinatorial modeling and solving paradigms. As programming languages we plan to allow C, C++, C#, Java8, Java10, Python2, Python3, Rust, and VB.NET. The source code of the solvers have to be released under an open source license (e.g. GPL, MIT, or public domain). The used solvers in the back-end may include commercial solvers such as [IBM Cplex](http://www-01.ibm.com/software/integration/optimization/cplex-optimizer), [gurobi](https://www.gurobi.com/), as well as open source solvers. For parallel solving on GPUs, we aim for Nvidia cuda.

## Competition Tracks

The challenge will likely consists of two separate tracks: 
* exact counting and
* heuristic or weighted counting (sum-of-weights)

The problem is known to be computationally hard.
