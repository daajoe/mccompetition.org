# Competition Tracks

The challenge consists of two separate tracks: 
1. [Model Counting (MC)](about.md), and
2. [Weighted Model Counting (WMC)](about.md)

Note that we only allow non-parallel solvers.
For more details on active calls for benchmark instances and participation, 
we refer to [Submission & Important Dates](dates.md).

## Benchmark Instances

There will be 200 benchmark instances for each track, labeled (w)mc_001.dimacs to (w)mc_200.dimacs for the track on (W)MC, respectively. 
 
Larger numbers in the filename should (as a rule of thumb) correspond to harder instances. 
The odd instances are public and the even instances will be provided later (secret). 


## Evaluation 

- timeout: 30 minutes per instance
- measure: TBA; likely PAR-2, where timed-out runs are counted as 2 times the given timeout time.
- objective: minimize the measure


## Track 1: Model Counting

If the solver does not output the exact solution - the solver will not be disqualified, which ensures that we do not require arbitrary precision.

## Track 2: Weighed Model Counting

The solution does not have to be exact, but we expect 1% accuracy.
