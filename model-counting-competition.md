# Competition Tracks

The challenge consists of two separate tracks: 
1. [Model Counting (MC)](about.md), and
2. [Weighted Model Counting (WMC)](about.md)

Note that we only allow non-parallel solvers.
For more details on active calls for benchmark instances and participation, 
we refer to [Submission & Important Dates](dates.md).



## Track 1: Model Counting

If the solver does not output the exact solution - the solver will not be disqualified, which ensures that we do not require arbitrary precision.


## Track 2: Weighed Model Counting

The solution does not have to be exact, but we expect 1% accuracy.
