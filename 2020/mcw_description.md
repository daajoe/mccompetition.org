# Workshop on Model Counting (MCW 2020@SAT)

## Purpose
The _International Workshop on Model Counting (MCW 2020)_ aims to provide a venue for researchers working on model counting such as model counting (mc), weighted model counting/sum of products (wmc), projected model counting (pmc) within the realm but not restricting to Boolean satisfiability (SAT),  satisfiability modulo theories (SMT), Answer set programming (ASP), and constraint programming (CP). 
It encourages to meet, communicate, and discuss the latest theoretical and practical results, in particular results on novel solvers, related solver technologies, new theoretical advances, practical academic and industrial applications as well as the linking theory and practice. 
 The workshop is also the place for developers of model counters to present their solvers and the presentation of detailed results on the model counting competition.



## Background
The success of solver technologies for declarative languages, such as SAT, in the last two decades is mainly due to both the availability of numerous efficient solver implementations and to the growing number of problems that can efficiently be solved through the declarative approach. Designing efficient solvers requires both understanding of the fundamental algorithms underlying the solvers, as well as in-depth insights into how to implement the algorithms for obtaining efficient and robust solvers.  
The aim of the workshop is to allow researchers to share both fundamental theoretical insights into practical solvers, as well as new implementation-level insights and 'gory' technical details about their systems that may at times be difficult to publish in the main conferences on the declarative solving paradigms.

## Interest
Main areas of interest include, but are not restricted to:

- techniques for debugging or certifying solvers
- visualisation of benchmarks structure
- monitoring solver behaviour
- evaluation of solvers
- efficient data structures
- domain specific encodings
- taking into account multi-core technology
- domain specific heuristics
- new application of constraint-based technologies
- new use cases of constraint-based technologies
- system/library description
- solver API
