# Workshop on Model Counting (MCW-2020): Submission Information

## Submissions
We follow the workshop on Pragmatics of SAT and welcome three categories of papers:

- Original papers: describing original work on a topic of the workshop, including papers whose focus might be too narrow to be published in a conference. Short original papers, approximately 2-8 pages in length, including system descriptions of model counters and related solver technologies are also welcome.
- Work-in-progress papers: describing less mature work on a topic of the workshop, to gather feedback from the community.
- Presentation-only papers: describing a work on a topic of the workshop recently accepted or published to another conference, but that the community may have missed (including, e.g., domain-specific applications of declarative solvers at the respective domain-specific conferences). Submissions to this category will be evaluated only on their relevance to the workshop.


The papers must be submitted electronically through [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=mcw2020) as a PDF file using the EasyChair proceedings style. Each submission is limited to <span style="color:blue">14 pages, plus references. Shorter papers (2-6 pages) are encouraged.</span> Source-codes and data downloads are appreciated. An appendix or external material is allowed, but reading is left to the discretion of the reviewers.  

Submissions are not expected to be double-blind, but can be submitted double blind if the authors prefer.


## Out of Scope
Papers claiming to resolve a major long-standing open theoretical question in Mathematics or Computer Science (such as those for which a Millennium Prize is offered), are outside the scope of the workshop.


Each submission should have an overall length of 1-4 pages in LNCS format. Authors may decide to include an appendix with additional material. Appendices will be considered at the reviewers' discretion.
