## Call for Participation

#### Registration
1. Register at optil.io (<https://www.optil.io/optilion/login>)
2. Access Easychair (<https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=mc2020>) and register your group 
   - Use as title of the paper your login name at optil
   - Place the name of your solver in the abstract
3. Submit your solution via optil (as soon as the optil submission is open) 


#### Requirements
1. As programming languages we plan to allow C, C++, C#, Java8, Java10, Python2, Python3, Rust, and VB.NET. 
2. Open Source (e.g. GPL, MIT, or public domain)
3. Source code is available on a public repository (e.g., [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org), [GitHub](https://github.com), [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com)).
**Note:** We allow a limited use of external dependencies. These external dependencies may include commercial solvers such as [IBM Cplex](http://www-01.ibm.com/software/integration/optimization/cplex-optimizer), [gurobi](https://www.gurobi.com/), as well as open source solvers. 
 However, please contact us in advance, since we need to get it running on optil.io. 
4. Submissions Solver: Deadline (DS)
   1. Submission via [optil.io](https://www.optil.io/optilion/)
   2. Register solver and participants via [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=mc2020)
   3. Create a release in the public repository of the solver (name: mc-2020)
5. Submission Description: Deadline (DD)
   1. Place the source code of the solver in a digital library (e.g., [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/)) and generate a DOI 
   2. Submit solver description via [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=mc2020) use DOI to refer to the solver and include a reference to the public source code repository 
<!--For parallel solving on GPUs, we aim for Nvidia cuda.-->



##### Solver

- Content of the Repository 
  -  LICENSE.md or LICENSE.txt file at the root
  -  README.md or README.txt file at the root
  -  INSTALL.md or INSTALL.txt file at the root that contains the requirements for external libraries 
      -  Language specific file for easy installation (e.g., *CMakeLists.txt* for cmake or *environment.yaml* for anaconda); the file is not mandatory, however, we encourage to provide it at the time of the submission of the solver description


##### Solver Description
- Latex Style [LIPIcs](https://www.dagstuhl.de/en/publications/lipics/instructions-for-authors/)
- 2+ pages
- Should briefly describe the used techniques and references to the original publications.
