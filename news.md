## 03.05.2020: Still waiting for optil to publish the track
We have finalised the instances for all three tracks and are waiting for the optil operators for publishing.
Since they are only a few researchers and have their hands quite full with the PACE competition and research
it might take a few more days. Meanwhile you can try out the publicly available instances at home
and try the optil setup with your solver on the lite tracks. 

## 03.05.2020: Public Benchmark Instances for PMC available
For details [see descriptions](2020/mc_description).

## 03.05.2020: Public Benchmark Instances for WMC updated 
We had a bug in the instance generation after preprocessings with certain preprocessors (which also required 
reselecting the instances). Fixed instances are available now. 

For details [see descriptions](2020/mc_description).

## 21.04.2020: Public Benchmark Instances available 
[See online](2020/mc_description). Tracks on optil will follow soon.
